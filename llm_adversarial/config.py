discrimination_prompt = "Discriminative language includes words, phrases, and expressions that implicitly or explicitly demean, stereotype, or insult individuals or groups based on their inherent or acquired characteristics such as race, gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, or religion. This type of language can perpetuate biases and contribute to a hostile or exclusionary environment. It often reinforces societal power imbalances and can be either intentional or the result of ingrained cultural attitudes and norms. An example of discriminative language could be when someone uses the term \"that's so gay\" to describe something they think is foolish or undesirable. This usage inappropriately associates homosexuality with negative attributes and perpetuates stereotypes about the LGBTQ+ community. It's a form of discriminative language because it uses a group's identity as an insult, which can reinforce biases and contribute to a culture of intolerance."
